    Memory Bound: 64.1% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 31.3% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.

        L2 Bound: 0.0% of Clockticks
        L3 Bound: 4.9% of Clockticks
        DRAM Bound: 38.6% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
         | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
         | performance.

            DRAM Bandwidth Bound: 25.2% of Elapsed Time
             | The system spent much time heavily utilizing DRAM bandwidth.
             | Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to
             | memory using these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of
             | each cacheline before it is evicted (for example, reorder
             | structure elements and split non-hot ones); 2) merge compute-
             | limited and bandwidth-limited loops; 3) use NUMA optimizations on
             | a multi-socket system. Note: software prefetches do not help a
             | bandwidth-limited application. Run Memory Access analysis to
             | identify data structures to be allocated in High Bandwidth Memory
             | (HBM), if available.
             |
        Store Bound: 0.2% of Clockticks
        NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 53.1%
         | A significant amount of DRAM loads were serviced from remote DRAM.
         | Wherever possible, try to consistently use data on the same core, or
         | at least the same package, as it was allocated on.
