    Memory Bound: 55.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 41.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 0.1% of Clockticks
        L3 Bound: 6.2% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or contended
         | with a sibling Core. Avoiding cache misses (L2 misses/L3 hits)
         | improves the latency and increases performance.
         |
        DRAM Bound: 20.3% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
         | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
         | performance.

            DRAM Bandwidth Bound: 1.5% of Elapsed Time
        Store Bound: 0.3% of Clockticks
        NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 50.5%
         | A significant amount of DRAM loads were serviced from remote DRAM.
         | Wherever possible, try to consistently use data on the same core, or
         | at least the same package, as it was allocated on.
